# Computer-Security-Task-2
This is the second task that I have to deliver on a Computer Security course I am attending

## How Secure is my Password?
You will develop a program that tests the strength of passwords. A sample program could be found in [howsecureismypassword.net](http://howsecureismypassword.net). Your program should display the time in seconds that it takes to crack a given password, based on the settings (calculations per second). You should also display all the information in the details section.

You are free to use a programming language of your choice.

**Deliverables:**

1. A document in **pdf** format that demonstrates the functionality of the program (screenshots) and a *read me* section on how to run the program.
2. The source code of the program
